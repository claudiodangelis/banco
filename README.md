# Banco

## Note: it's really basic

Banco Management System, or simply Banco, is an opinionated project manager for the command line.

Projects consists in a set of things like:
- documents
- bookmarks
- notes
- tasks

Banco creates files and folders. No database, no cloud services, no mobile apps. 

```sh
banco init
```


```sh
banco new note
```

```sh
banco notes
```
